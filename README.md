# Annotations-XML-to-CSV
Convert xml files to csv for training purposes
Users need to manually give the ' file_path ' that contains path to each image. USers need to also manually give the csv file headers. SEE line 8  

Yolo requires directories with same sturucture 'images' and 'labels' or 'Annotations', so make sure to knwo the directory requirements and make changes to replace() function in the code.
